# Continuous-Integration-and-Deployment-with-Jenkins
Automate the build, test, and deployment process for a sample web application using Jenkins.

## Project Components:

__Source Code Repository:__ Host the sample web application code on GitHub.

__Jenkins Server:__ Set up Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.

__Docker:__ Use Docker to containerize the web application for consistent builds and deployments.

__Build Pipeline:__ Create a Jenkins pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

## Project Steps:

__Set up the Web Application:__
1. Create a simple Node.js web application using Express.js.
2. Initialize a Git repository for the project and push it to GitHub.
   
__Configure Jenkins:__
1. Install Jenkins on your server or use a cloud-based Jenkins instance.
2. Set up necessary plugins like Git, Docker, Node.js, etc., in Jenkins.

__Create Jenkins Pipeline:__
1. Define a Jenkins pipeline using a Jenkinsfile to automate the CI/CD process.
2. Use stages like "Build," "Test," and "Deploy" in the pipeline.

__Build Stage:__
1. Pull the source code from the GitHub repository.
2. Build the Docker image for the web application.

__Test Stage:__
1. Run automated tests on the Docker container to ensure code quality and functionality.
   
__Deploy Stage:__
1. Deploy the Docker container to a target environment (e.g., staging or production).
   
__Monitor and Notifications:__
1. Set up monitoring and notifications in Jenkins to track build status and receive alerts for failures.

## Project Workflow:
1. Developer pushes code changes to the GitHub repository.
2. Jenkins detects the changes and triggers the build pipeline.
3. Jenkins pulls the code, builds the Docker image, runs tests, and deploys the container.
4. If successful, Jenkins notifies stakeholders. If failed, Jenkins alerts the team for investigation.

## Benefits:
1. Automated and streamlined development process.
2. Consistent builds and deployments across environments.
3. Faster feedback loop with automated testing.
4. Improved collaboration and visibility with centralized CI/CD pipeline.

## Notes:
Replace placeholders like yourusername, yourwebapp, your-registry-url, and your-docker-credentials with your actual values.
Customize the pipeline stages, scripts, and notifications as per your project requirements and best practices.
